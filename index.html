    </header>

	<p>In the recent years, discussions and debates related to gender inequality, especially
		towards women, have become more and more common. From violence based on a
		personâ€™s gender to difference in treatment at work places, the topic can be brought up
		everywhere and all the time. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of the main causes 
		of this plague and this visualization will allow us to better understand it.</p>
	
	<h1 class="titleClass" style="margin-top: 5%;">Quick overview of the dataset</h1>
	<p>17,160 adults across 17 countries and 6 continents have been asked to answer one question 
		- Which, if any, do you personally thing are the main reasons why women may not be equal 
		to men in your country? Each participant had 11 possible answers to this question.<br>
		The dataset used for this project and the visualization below is part of the international survey on public perception gender equality 
		conducted by Focus 2030 and Women Deliver.<br>
	</p>
	<p>The dataset can be found at: <url>https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w6</url></p>
	
	
	<h1 class="titleClass" style="margin-top: 5%;">Description of the visualization</h1>
	<p>This visualization allows the user to understand the causes of gender inequality according to different opinions for each gender in different countries.<br><br></p>
	
	<h3> WHO is the visualization for?</h3>
	<p>This visualization is intended for all people interested in the subject of gender inequality and wish to understand the causes of this phenomenon. We believe that
		each person regardless of their gender should help in the conquest of gender equality and it starts by understanding what is causing inequality in the first place.<br><br>
	</p>
	<h3>WHY we the audience should care about it</h3>
	<p>
		Caring about gender inequality causes helps understand how to gender equality. In addition to the fact that gender equality is one the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations to reach
		by 2030, gender inequality is also a topic we face on a daily basis at every corner of our lives from home to work passing by streets and transports.<br><br>
	</p>
	<h3>HOW to read the visualization?</h3>
	<p>
		The visualization below is a world map showing pie charts representing locals answers to the question "Thinking about the list of reasons below which if any do you personally think are the main reasons why women may not 
	be equal to men in your country?". The survey contains 11 possible answers which are detailed in the labels bar below the map.<br>
	In order to make the visualization simpler, the colors chosen in the pie charts are very different from one another and can help give a general overview of opinions differences in the world, in a continent, and among the 
	country itself. <br>

	<h1 class="titleClass" style="margin-top: 5%;">Analysis</h1>
	<p id="analysis">In order to conduct an analysis of our data through the visualization available, we first started by grouping aspects that interested us: <br>
	- <b>Do opinions on gender inequality causes differ around the world?</b><br>
	- <b>Do men and women tend to have different opinions on these causes and how do they vary?</b><br><br>
	
	Answering the first question requires comparing global answers (for both genders) across the globe. By choosing very distinct colors in our pie charts, this task was made simple as 
	it is easier to see colors that appear the most directly from the map. Some of the conclusions and patterns we have reached with this comparison are the following:<br>
	- <b>In Europe</b>, all four available countries share the same top 3 gender inequality reasons (taking almost or more than 50% of the opinions when grouped). They are the following:<br>
	<span class="tab"></span>- Because unpaid care - domestic work - and parental responsibilities are not shared equally between women and men<br>
	<span class="tab"></span>- Because women and men have different employment opportunities<br>
	<span class="tab"></span>- Because boys and girls are treated differently growing up<br><br>
	- In <b>Africa</b>, a different pattern can be observed. While the unpaid domestic work reason remains in the top 3 of the causes, two other reasons appear to be just as important and they are:<br>
	<span class="tab"></span>- Because of religion and culture that do not treat women and men as equals<br>
	<span class="tab"></span>- Because women and men are not equally represented in politics<br><br>

	- In other continents, patterns were less prominent. In <b>Asia</b>, no common pattern can be observed between the countries: China, India, and Japan. In <b>America</b>, the pattern is close to the European
	one but with slight different in Canada and the US. In <b>Latin America</b> on the other hand, the religious reason takes up a large percentage in the reasons. Finally, in <b>Oceania</b>, both Australia and New Zealand
	share at the top of the answers the domestic work and employment opportunities aspects.

	When it comes to the second question, we go through the pie charts showing both men and women opinions in each country. In general, we notice that they tend to agree 
	on the main causes of gender inequality in their country; however, a shared behaviour in all countries is that <em>men underestimate the domestic work cause most of the time while women give it a larger importance.</em><br><br>
	Other than this general observation on men vs women opinions, we can notice specific behaviours in some countries:<br>
	<span class="tab"></span>- In <b>France, Germany, and India</b>, men believe that religion is an aspect that contributes to gender inequality while women don't. This is mainly visible in France where 18.92% of men think that religion
	is a cause for gender inequality while 13.54% of women agree.<br>
	<span class="tab"></span>- In <b>Switzerland</b>, men and women's opinions don't vary much except on employment opportunities which 24.15% of women think of as a cause of gender inequality against 18.52% of men.<br>
	<span class="tab"></span>- The country in which men and women's opinions vary the most is <b>Tunisia</b> with men and women mainly disagreeing on the politics aspect, domestic work aspect, and the way boys and girls are treated growing. In the latter, 21,47% of women
	believe the way boys and girls are treated growing up contributes to gender inequality against only 10,18% of men sharing the same opinion.<br>
	<span class="tab"></span>- On the other side of the spectrum, the country where men and women's opinions are almsot identical is <b>China</b> where the largest difference is between 16.41% of women agreeing that employment opportunities are a cause to gender inequality
	against 14.94% of men having the same opinion.<br>
	</p>

	<h1 class="titleClass" style="margin-top: 5%;">Key Takeaways and Conclusion</h1>
	<p id="analysis">
		In this section, we sum up the main takeaways we have from the analysis and visualization above:<br>
		<span class="tab"></span><b class="colorful">1.</b> In general, men and women tend to have close opinions on gender inequality causes. 
		However, men always underestimate the importance of the unpaid care and domestic work responsibilities.<br>
		<span class="tab"></span><b class="colorful">2.</b> The religious aspect is prominent in African countries, Latin America, and India. 
		It is almost discareded in Japan and takes a moderate place in the rest of the world.<br>
		<span class="tab"></span><b class="colorful">3.</b> The country where men and women disagree most in Tunisia while the country where men and
		women agree most is China.<br>
		<span class="tab"></span><b class="colorful">4.</b> European countries share the same top 3 causes: domestic work aspect, employment opportunities aspect, and the way boys nd girls are treated while growing up aspect.<br><br>
	
		This analysis answers our question on the causes of gender inequality around the world based on the opinions of each country's population; male and female. It helps understand the obstacles to gender equality but also 
		contributes to solving the problem of inequality by giving information of the main causes that have to be improved.
